   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

=============================================
Welcome to Strabo Canyon Map's documentation!
=============================================

Here you will find documentation for the public and private ends of the Reed Canyon Map project.

The documentation is set up with: 
    1. Installation instructions, installation help guide, and a guide to configuration.
    2. General concepts, a document of potential issues and to-dos, and a primer to working with Sphinx (the Python documentation engine used to generate these files).
    3. Detailed references to specific modules in the code. 

.. note::
    ** *This is a work in progress.* **
